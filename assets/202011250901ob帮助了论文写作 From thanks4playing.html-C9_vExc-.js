I am a PhD candidate in the study of religion of the ancient Mediterranean world, integrating other disciplines like sociology, anthropology, ethnography, etc. I used Obsidian for a brand new research project that turned into a full-length article publication at the top journal of my field! It took me only 3 months from start to finish thanks to Obsidian (most research articles take about 2 years in my field). I&#39;m seriously debating if I should include Obsidian in my acknowledgements lol</p><p>Certainly! If you would like more information, then just let me know. Here is a rough outline on how Obsidian made the process much more efficient and effective:</p><ol><li>I began with a brand new topic to which I had very little exposure</li><li>I created a provisional bibliography that grew in # of sources as well as organization/themes. Each entry was a backlink that I would fill out as I go</li><li>My project/paper is very interdisciplinary (e.g., sociolinguistics, ritual theory, anthropology, neuroscience, ethology, sociology, religious studies, classics, ancient history), so being able to find recurring themes/ideas in a cogent way was very critical. I&#39;d be sure make backlinks and quick notes so that I could write about these interactions later. This made my research standout as I wasn&#39;t just repeating scholarly debates, but I was adding a new perspective/assessment on existing debates.</li><li>Although Obsidian was very helpful, I still had to put in the work! Nothing replaces good reading/notetaking, and critical/creative thinking</li><li>Obsidian tags, highlights, backlinks, and blockquotes were the most instrumental.</li><li>With tags, it wasn&#39;t so much the search feature, but the ability to quickly see them as I would review my notes. So tags, highlights, and blockquotes were easy way for me to review the salient points of my notes</li><li>With backlinks, they were useful as I mentioned for the working bibliography. But also I could create notes on certain thoughts that I think would serve as key premises for my argument. I&#39;d create them as a backlink and fill that note as I would progressively do my research</li></ol><p>Now onto the draft/writing phase. All of the key ideas were there in my notes, so it was just a matter of referencing them via backlinks. Essentially, I&#39;d create an outline where each section was a list of key ideas and backlinks. Then writing each section in my own words was easier because I knew both the main idea and the key sources for my argument.<br> Now onto the revision process. I would granularize and enumerate each comment from the reviewers. With each comment, I would make a list of backlinks (both existing of future ones) to address each comment. At this point, Obsidian had rolled out block references, which made this even easier!</p><p>From <a href="https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/694233507500916796/780808662376906762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/694233507500916796/780808662376906762</a></p><p>工作流 <a href="https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/694233507500916796/780891058757959680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/694233507500916796/780891058757959680</a></p><p>中文粗略翻译：<br> 大家好，我有个好消息!我是一名研究古地中海世界宗教的博士研究生，整合了社会学、人类学、民族志等其他学科。我用黑曜石做了一个全新的研究项目，并在我的领域的顶级期刊上发表了一篇完整的文章!多亏了黑曜石，我从开始到完成只花了3个月的时间(在我的领域里，大多数研究论文都要花2年时间)。我在认真考虑我是否应该在我的致谢中加入黑曜石，哈哈</p><p>当然!如果你想知道更多的信息，请告诉我。以下是黑曜石如何使这一过程更加高效和有效的大致轮廓:</p><ol><li>我开始了一个全新的话题，我很少接触到这个话题</li><li>我创建了一个临时的参考书目，在资源和组织/主题方面都有增长。每一项都是一个反向链接，我将填写我走<br> 3.我的课题/论文是跨学科的(例如，社会语言学、仪式理论、人类学、神经科学、动物行为学、社会学、宗教研究、经典著作、古代史)，所以能够以一种令人信服的方式找到重复出现的主题/思想是非常关键的。我一定会做反向链接和快速笔记，这样我以后就可以写下这些互动。这使得我的研究脱颖而出，因为我不仅仅是在重复学术辩论，而是在现有辩论中增加了一个新的视角/评估。</li><li>虽然黑曜石很有用，但我还是要投入工作!没有什么能取代好的阅读/记笔记，批判性/创造性思维</li><li>黑曜石标签、高亮显示、反向链接和blockquotes是最常用的工具。</li><li>使用标签，与其说是搜索功能，不如说是快速查看它们的能力，就像我复习笔记一样。因此，标记、高亮和blockquotes是我复习笔记要点的简单方法。</li><li>有了反向链接，它们对工作参考书目很有用。但我也可以对某些想法做笔记，我认为这些想法可以作为我的论点的关键前提。我会创建他们作为一个反向链接，并填写笔记，因为我将逐步做我的研究<br> 现在进入草稿/写作阶段。所有的关键思想都在我的笔记里，所以这只是通过反向链接引用它们的问题。本质上，我会创建一个大纲，其中每个部分都是一个关键思想和反向链接的列表。然后用我自己的话写每个部分就容易多了，因为我知道我的论点的主要思想和关键来源。<br> 现在进入修订过程。我将把评论家们的每一条评论一一罗列出来。对于每个评论，我将制作一个反向链接列表(现有的和将来的)来处理每个评论。在这一点上，Obsidian已经推出了块引用，这使这更容易!/emm</li></ol>',9)])])}const c=t(n,[["render",r]]),h=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/09%20%E7%A2%8E%E8%AE%B0/202011250901ob%E5%B8%AE%E5%8A%A9%E4%BA%86%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E5%86%99%E4%BD%9C%20From%20thanks4playing.html","title":"202011250901ob帮助了论文写作 From thanks4playing","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"description":"obsidian使用心得（MOC） Hi Everyone, I have some great news!
